# Hofstadter_butterfly

In this project, we generate Hofstadter butterfly numerically. The starting point of our discussion is a one-band Hamiltonian under external magnetic field.  
H = T+U
where T is the typical hopping term and U is sinusoidal potential due to the lattice. When an external magnetic field is applied, both the hopping term and the For more information, see TKNN's original paper.

Hofstadter butterfly can be obtained from solving Harper's equation.
